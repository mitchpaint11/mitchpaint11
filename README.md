Hi, I'm Mitchell Painter.

I am enjoying learning and developing my expertise and experience in the following technologies:
- HTML5/XHTML
- CSS/SCSS
- Ruby/Ruby on Rails
- JavaScript
- MERN Stack 
    - MongoDB, 
    - Express.js,
    - React.js,
    - Node.js.
- JSON Manipulation
- SQL/NoSQL
- UX/UI Design
- Agile Project Management
- Computer Science/Web Theory
- GIT Source Control

I am dedicated, hard-working and take great pride in all I set my mind to. I have a great interest in furthering my knowledge in the tech industry 
and working in a robust collaborative environment where I can develop my skills, and have a positive impact.

When I'm not creating, collaborating or coding, you'll find me listening to music, playing the guitar, cycling, hiking or shredding a mountain somewhere on a snowboard.
